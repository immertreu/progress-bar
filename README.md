## Progress Bar
This is a CRA project. You can just run yarn install and yarn start to start it up on port 3000. 

All code associated with the progress bar itself can be found in the ProgressBar directory.

### Ideas for improvement
* Add ability to customize label text placement. 
* Add ability to adjust speed of animation.
* Add aria attributes to make progress bar legible for screenreaders.
* Allow users to select from different shapes of progress bars by using svg rather than a div. (Deluxe version)
